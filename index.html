            <p id="blocktext"> My name is Eleonore Chevillion.
                I am 25 and I was born in Paris (the most beautiful city in the world !) <br>
                Two years ago, after finishing my master, litteraly 10 days after my last class, I decided to move to
                New York for a new adventure !
                I had never been to the City before and was, honestly, terrified. Everything was giagantic, fast, loud
                and awfully smelly (New York summer).
                After working in the furniture industry as a Commercial Coordinator I decided to take up a new
                challenge, and learn how to code.
                I have always been fascinated by technology and really wanted to understand how programming actually
                worked.
                I would also love to start my own business in a few years, and knowing how to code will be a key skill.
